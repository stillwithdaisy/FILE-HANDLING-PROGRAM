## A C PROGRAM DEMONSTRATING VARIOUS FILE OPERATIONS
I USED VISUAL STUDIO CODE APPLICATION TO WRITE, COMPILE, AND RUN THE CODE.  USED C/C++ EXTENSION TO COMPILE THE CODE AND CODERUNNER EXTENSION TO RUN THE CODE. By this we can handle different kinds of file operations like read, write, open, etc.
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of various file operations using the C programming language. The primary objective is to explore and implement different file-handling techniques such as creating files, reading from files, writing to files, appending content, and closing files. The project was developed, compiled, and executed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), one of the most popular and lightweight source code editors. To support C programming, I installed the C/C++ extension by Microsoft for code intelligence and debugging and used the Code Runner extension to streamline the execution process.

File operations in C are crucial for performing data persistence, logging, configuration storage, and a wide variety of real-world applications where interaction with external data is essential. In this project, I aimed to cover the fundamental file operations supported by the C Standard Library using the stdio.h header file. These operations include:

File Creation
I used the fopen() function in write ("w") and append ("a") modes to create new files. If a file with the specified name did not exist, it was created. If it already existed, its content was either overwritten (write mode) or preserved (append mode).

Writing to a File
The fprintf() and fputs() functions were utilized to write text and structured data to the file. This demonstrates how to store user input or predefined content to a file efficiently.

Reading from a File
I implemented reading functions such as fscanf(), fgets(), and fgetc() to retrieve data from a file. These techniques are essential for processing and displaying stored information. I also added checks to handle end-of-file (EOF) conditions.

Appending Data
I showed how the "a" mode of fopen() can be used to add new data to the end of an existing file without removing its current content. This is particularly useful for logging or tracking updates.

File Closure and Error Handling
Every file operation was followed by a call to fclose() to release system resources. Additionally, I included error-checking logic to ensure robust handling of failed file operations, such as trying to read a non-existent file.

The development environment, Visual Studio Code, provided a productive interface with features such as syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and real-time debugging. I installed the C/C++ extension, which allowed for seamless code completion and error checking. For compilation, I used gcc integrated with VS Code tasks, and the Code Runner extension provided an easy and quick way to execute the program and view the output in the terminal.

This project not only deepened my understanding of file handling in C but also enhanced my familiarity with the development tools and extensions in Visual Studio Code. By integrating core programming concepts with a modern development environment, I was able to simulate a real-world development workflow. This project can serve as a foundation for more complex applications involving data storage and file-based communication.
